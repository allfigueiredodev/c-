1) Create the Intern class:
	• it has to have the Form* makeForm(std::string name, std::string target) function;
	• The first string argument is the name of a form, and second is the target
	of the form;
	• The name of the object that will be returned is the same name passed as 
	the first argument of the makeForm function, the object has to have its
	target attribute initialized with the second argument of the function;
	• If there is no Form with the name passed as the first argument the program
	should print a explicit error, if it does, it should print something like:
	Intern creates <form>
